## 2. Subqueries ##

SELECT Major, Unemployment_rate
FROM recent_grads
WHERE Unemployment_rate < (
    SELECT AVG(Unemployment_rate)
    FROM recent_grads
)
ORDER BY Unemployment_rate

## 3. Subquery In SELECT ##

SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) as float)/CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recent_grads) as float) as proportion_abv_avg
FROM recent_grads
WHERE ShareWomen > (SELECT AVG(ShareWomen) FROM recent_grads)

## 4. Returning Multiple Results In Subqueries ##

SELECT Major, Major_category
FROM recent_grads
WHERE Major_category IN 
(SELECT Major_category FROM recent_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
ORDER BY SUM(Total) DESC
LIMIT 5)

## 5. Building Complex Subqueries ##

SELECT AVG(CAST(Sample_size as float)/CAST(Total as float)) as avg_ratio
FROM recent_grads


## 6. Practice Integrating A Subquery With The Outer Query ##

SELECT Major, Major_category, CAST(Sample_size as float)/CAST(Total as float) ratio
FROM recent_grads
WHERE ratio > 
(SELECT AVG(CAST(Sample_size as float)/CAST(Total as float)) as avg_ratio
FROM recent_grads)
